```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)

```
# Loading Data from github file

  rename(
    CandyName = competitorname,
    Chocolate = chocolate,
    WinPercent = winpercent
  )

```

# Changing the values in the chocolate column from 1's or 0's to "Yes" or "No"
